### Modes

#### Fast

Reach your goal level with the least amount of skill level ups - *ideal when buying levels from ingame trainers.*

#### Easy

At lower levels, skills level faster. Easy Mode takes this into consideration and suggests a plan requiring lots of skill level ups, but relatively little skill XP.

#### Balanced

Train all (selected) skills equally. - *for realistically playable progress*


## Extras
* Playstyle templates - Select your preferred skills conveniently
* Player race selection for new characters - Skip the character level form
* Export your results
