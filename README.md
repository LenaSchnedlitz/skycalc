### Modes

#### Fast

Reach your goal level with the least amount of skill level ups - _ideal when buying levels from ingame trainers._

#### Easy

At lower levels, skills level faster. Easy Mode takes this into consideration and suggests a plan requiring lots of skill level ups, but relatively little skill XP.

#### Balanced

Train all (selected) skills equally. - _for realistically playable progress_

## Extras

- Player race selection for new characters - Skip the character level form
